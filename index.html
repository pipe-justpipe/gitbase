        <h4 style="color: blue;"><i> What does it mean to be <big>peculiar</big>?</i></h4><hr/>
        <P>Recently i started taking a course on web development. The first thing we dealt with is <b style="color: blue;"><big>HTML</big></b> which means <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b> So far, i have been taught how to choose a text editorr and i have gladly chosen visual studio code. Next thing is naming he file using .html, omoh it's still appearing simple. I know various tags and how to use them, to use subscript tag, just do H<sub>2</sub>O for superscript, to write the square of 10 meaning 10 multiplied by 10 you go 10<sup>2</sup> </P>
        <h4 style="color: red;">Style and Colors</h4>
        <p>2Style and colors will help us style any tag by changing the background color or color of individual elements as i will be showing you soon. If i want to change the background of the whole body, i will put something like <!-- <body>style="background - color: light blue;"</body> --></p>
        <p>i want to color a paragraph using <!-- <p style= "color: cyan;"></p>--></p>
        <p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The tutorial has been really helpful and i can say that i am happy at the stage i am.</p>
